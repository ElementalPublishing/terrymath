# Terry's Law

**Terry's Law** is a universal, immutable, and extendable mathematical and physical framework.  
It governs all calculations, simulations, and logic in this engine, replacing traditional arithmetic and physics with the rules of TerryMath.

---

## Core Principles

- **Immutable**: Terry's Law cannot be broken or bypassed. All modules and systems must use TerryMath for their calculations.
- **Extendable**: Terry's Law applies to all realms—physics, geometry, graphics, AI, and beyond.
- **Universal**: Every calculation, from the simplest addition to the most complex simulation, is bound by Terry's Law.

## TerryMath Engine

- **Modes**: TerryMath supports multiple arithmetic modes (e.g., `a_times_b`, `a_plus_b`, `a_plus_b_minus_1`, `terry_original`).
- **Core Operations**: All addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and power operations are performed using TerryMath.
- **Vectors & Matrices**: TerryVector2, TerryVector3, TerryMatrix2x2, TerryMatrix3x3, and advanced types in `terrylinalg.py` all use TerryMath.

---

## TerryPhysics

- **Newtonian Fundamentals**: Inertia, F=ma, action/reaction, gravity, momentum, energy, friction, and collisions—all powered by TerryMath.
- **Bodies & World**: TerryBody and TerryWorld classes simulate motion, forces, and interactions, always using Terry's Law.
- **Universal Gravitation**: Terry's Law governs gravitational attraction between all bodies.

---

## TerryGeometry

- **Primitives**: Points, lines, rays, planes, spheres, boxes, triangles, cubes, and quads.
- **Intersection & Containment**: All geometric tests and mesh generation use TerryMath.

---

## TerryLinalg

- **Advanced Linear Algebra**: 4x4 matrices, quaternions, interpolation, and rotation—all using TerryMath.

---

## TerryShader

- **Procedural Graphics**: TerryMath powers all shader logic, patterns, and procedural effects.

---

## The Spirit of Terry's Law

- **All modules, all features, all realms—are bound by Terry's Law.**
- **No calculation escapes its reach.**
- **Terry's Law is the foundation and the future of this engine.**

---

## Contributing

- All new modules must use TerryMath for their core logic.
- Extensions to new domains (AI, thermodynamics, quantum, etc.) must honor Terry's Law.
- Document all Terry-based logic and innovations in this file.

## The Future

Terry's Law is extendable to any domain:  
- Rotational dynamics, constraints, fluids, electromagnetism, thermodynamics, relativity, quantum, AI, and more.

**Terry's Law cannot be broken. It can only be expanded.**
